# This is the directory for the work for STAT 432 Project

## There are some `.gitignore` so please read below carefully to have the data ready to be played with

**Step 1:** Make a `raw/` folder (or rename your `data/` folder to `raw/`) and this where the Kaggle Datasets will live.
This is git ignored due to sheer size of the data so you are responsible to download and store the data appropriately.

**Step 2:** Make a `data/` folder where the "Cleaned" Dataframes will be stored. This will be created (currently) by `abhi.ipynb` so you just need to make sure Step 1 is done properly and `/data` folder is created, then just run the `abhi.ipynb` notebook! :D

**Note: ** I have also froze the requirements/dependencies into `requirements.txt`. So feel free to run this if any dependency is not there. Also, if you install a new dependency, please make sure to update the requirements by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in the terminal before pushing your code to the repo!

**More Details coming soon**
