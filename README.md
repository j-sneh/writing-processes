# This is the directory for the work for STAT 432 Project

## There are some `.gitignore` so please read below carefully to have the data ready to be played with

**Step 1:** Make a `raw/` folder (this is git ignored due to sheer size of the data) where the Kaggle Dataset will live. All the files from Kaggle reside here and you are responsible to store it.

**Step 2:** Make a `data/` folder where the "Cleaned" Dataframes will be stored. This will be created (currently) by `abhi.ipynb` so you just need to make sure Step 1 is done properly and `/data` folder is created, then just run the `abhi.ipynb` notebook! :D

**Note:** I have also froze the requirements/dependencies into `requirements.txt`. So feel free to run this if any dependency is not there. Also, if you install a new dependency, please make sure to update the requirements by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in the terminal before pushing your code to the repo!

**More Details coming soon**
